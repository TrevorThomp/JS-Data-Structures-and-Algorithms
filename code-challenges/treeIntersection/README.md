# Challenge Summary
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Challenge Description
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
The efficiency that was used is 0(n). The approach is to split the string into an array that is able to be looped through and added to the hash map. During this loop, the function will check to see if the value is already contained in the hash table. If it is, then return that value, if not, then add the value to the hash table.
