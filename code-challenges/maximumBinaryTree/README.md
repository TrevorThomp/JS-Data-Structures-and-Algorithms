# Challenge Summary
Find maximum value in Binary Tree.

## Challenge Description
Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
Declare a method that takes a tree object as an argument. Loop to the right until you reach the last node and return that value which will be the maximum value. This approach will have a Big O of 0(n).
