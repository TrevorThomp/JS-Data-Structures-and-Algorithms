## Challenge Description
Write a function that replaces values with either "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz" based on the divisibility of a said value in the tree.

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach is to run a method recursively that is going to check if the node values are divisible by 3 or 5. If they are, then they will be respectively replaced with the correct string. This method will loop through the nodes in the tree inOrder until it reaches the end of the tree.
