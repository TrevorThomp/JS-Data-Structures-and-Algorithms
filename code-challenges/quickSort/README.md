# Challenge Summary
* Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
* Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
* Present a complete set of working tests

## Challenge Description
Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

## Approach & Efficiency
The efficiency that was used in the pseudocode is 0(n). The approach is to grab a pivot point in each index that will be used to compare the values as it recursively loops through the arrays. Once the array has been pushed into the two empty arrays, then they will be concatenated at the end and returned in a final new array that will have the sorted data.
