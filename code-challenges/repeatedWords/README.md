## Challenge Description
Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter.
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.

## Approach & Efficiency
The efficiency that was used is 0(n). The approach is to grab a pivot point in each index that will be used to compare the values as it recursively loops through the arrays. Once the array has been pushed into the two empty arrays, then they will be concatenated at the end and returned in a final new array that will have the sorted data.
